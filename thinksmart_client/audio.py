"""Microphone and speaker.

Both go through PipeWire's ALSA plugin ("default"): opening the hardware PCMs directly
breaks this device's audio DSP until reboot, which is why the service runs with
PrivateDevices=yes. Both streams use latency="high": with "low" the capture callback
overflows now and then, the microphone falls behind the speaker reference and echo
cancellation stops working.

Capture: 16 kHz mono in 20 ms blocks. The callback only queues; a worker thread runs echo
cancellation and hands each cleaned block to on_block (wake word, upload, level meter).
Playback: 48 kHz stereo from a buffer; everything that is played (replies and local
sounds) is also what echo cancellation subtracts.

If PipeWire restarts, the streams stop (or hang) and their callbacks no longer run while the process
lives on: no wake word ever again. stalled() notices it and the client exits for systemd to restart it.

on_block gets two versions of each block: for uploading (WebRTC's full canceller) and for the wake
word, which while something plays gets the linear-only canceller's output instead (aec.py): the full
one suppresses too much of a voice talking over the reply to interrupt it.
