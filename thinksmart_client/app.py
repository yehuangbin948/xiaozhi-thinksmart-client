"""The voice client: wake word → listen → hub replies → follow-up window → idle.

States shown to the page: idle, connecting, listening, thinking, speaking.
- Wake (voice or button): chime, connect if needed, stream the microphone ("realtime": the
  hub cuts sentences with its VAD).
- Once the hub has recognised what was said, the microphone stops uploading until the reply has
  been played: talking during a reply (to someone else, "嗯", a cough) never interrupts it. Only
  the wake word (still listened for meanwhile) or the button does: the reply stops, the hub is told
  how much of it was heard (it keeps only that in the context), and what is said next is a new turn.
  The same while the hub is still recognising what was said (the wake word is listened for again
  once its VAD says the user stopped) or thinking: the question is dropped, whatever of that turn
  still arrives (its text, its reply) is ignored, and the mic opens for a new one at once.
- After a reply the microphone stays open for follow_up_seconds, then stops uploading.
  The connection itself stays until the hub closes it (no speech for ~2 minutes, an exit
  word, the end button), so waking again within that time keeps the conversation.
- The hub keeps every model's conversation on disk (data/chat.db) and gives the next connection
  its recent part, so the page's threads survive a closed connection and a restart: they are loaded
  from the hub (/kiosk/chat/history) when not connected. Clearing them (settings, or saying
  "清除聊天记录") clears the hub's copy too.
- The screen stays on while not idle and blanks after the user's screen-off (device.Screen); the volume
  keys and the mic-mute switch are handled here too (device.Keys).
- Reports (Grok Bot finishing later) are polled from the hub: when idle the client chimes and
  connects so the hub reads them; in the sleep hours (sleep.py) they wait on the screen and the
  screen is dimmed.
- Countdowns, alarms and reminders (alarms.py) are kept and rung here; the model only sets them
  through device tools. A ring lights the screen, switches the speaker to the alarm volume until it
  stops (the wake word, 停止 or 再睡 on the page; given up on after 10 minutes, a reminder (its chime and words over and over) after 3) and stops whatever
  the conversation was doing. The volume keys then change only that ring's volume.
